# 🐍 Python Projects Repository

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of **beginner-friendly Python projects** that I built while learning Python with the help of  **YouTube tutorials and hands-on practice** .

Each project helped me strengthen my understanding of core Python concepts such as:

* Variables & Data Types
* Conditional Statements
* Loops
* Functions
* File Handling
* Modules & Libraries
* Logical Thinking

This repository reflects my **learning journey in Python** and continuous improvement through practice.
